## Introduction

This section just covers that we will be using FFUF (Fuzz Faster You Fool)

## Web Fuzzing

This section gives an overview of what Fuzzing is and what Web Fuzzing is. They give the example that if we were fuzzing a sql injection attack we would provide a list of random characters to see if it will allow for injection. Similarly if we were fuzzing a buffer overflow, we would be providing gradually increasing strings. 

For web fuzzing, we are often fuzzing to find hidden or forgotten pages. So we might be fuzzing the URL with a list of frequently used page names. For this module it seems we will be using the SecLists directory-list-2.3-small.txt.

This can be found at `SecLists/Discovery/Web-Content/directory-list-2.3-small.txt`
