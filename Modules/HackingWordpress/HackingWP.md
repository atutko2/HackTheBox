## Intro

WordPress is the most popular open source Content Management System (CMS), powering nearly one-third of all websites in the world. It can be used for multiple purposes, such as hosting blogs, forums, e-commerce, project management, document management, and much more. WordPress is highly customizable as well as SEO friendly, which makes it popular among companies. It has a large library of extensions called themes and plugins, both free and paid, that can be added to enhance the website. Some examples of plugins are WPForms, a robust contact form, MonsterInsights that interfaces with Google Analytics, and Constant Contact, a popular email marketing service. However, its customizability and extensible nature make it prone to vulnerabilities through third-party themes and plugins. WordPress is written in PHP and usually runs on Apache with MySQL as the backend. Many hosting companies offer WordPress as an option when creating a new website and even assist with backend tasks such as security updates.

This module will cover a WordPress website's core structure, manual and automated enumeration techniques to uncover misconfigurations and vulnerabilities, and walk through a few common attacks. You will be given the opportunity to perform your own enumeration and attacks against a WordPress instance while working through the material in each section. The module will end with a Skills Assessment to tie together everything you have learned and complete all of the steps necessary to compromise a WordPress website and the underlying web server fully.

Happy hacking, and don't forget to think outside the box!

A CMS is a powerful tool that helps build a website without the need to code everything from scratch (or even know how to write code at all). The CMS does most of the "heavy lifting" on the infrastructure side to focus more on the design and presentation aspects of the website instead of the backend structure. Most CMS' provide a rich What You See Is What You Get (WYSIWYG) editor where users can edit content as if they were working in a word processing tool such as Microsoft Word. Users can upload media directly from a media library interface instead of interacting with the webserver either from a management portal or via FTP or SFTP.

A CMS is made up of two key components:

    A Content Management Application (CMA) - the interface used to add and manage content.
    A Content Delivery Application (CDA) - the backend that takes the input entered into the CMA and assembles the code into a working, visually appealing website.

A good CMS will provide extensibility, allowing you to add functionality and design elements to the site without needing to work with the website code, rich user management to provide fine-grained control over access permissions and roles, media management to allow the user to easily upload and embed photos and videos, and proper version control. When looking for a CMS, we should also confirm that it is well-maintained, receives periodic updates and upgrades, and has sufficient built-in security settings to harden the website from attackers.

## Wordpress Structure

WordPress can be installed on a Windows, Linux, or Mac OSX host. For this module, we will focus on a default WordPress installation on an Ubuntu Linux web server. WordPress requires a fully installed and configured LAMP stack (Linux operating system, Apache HTTP Server, MySQL database, and the PHP programming language) before installation on a Linux host. After installation, all WordPress supporting files and directories will be accessible in the webroot located at /var/www/html.

Below is the directory structure of a default WordPress install, showing the key files and subdirectories necessary for the website to function properly.

```
tree -L 1 /var/www/html
.
├── index.php
├── license.txt
├── readme.html
├── wp-activate.php
├── wp-admin
├── wp-blog-header.php
├── wp-comments-post.php
├── wp-config.php
├── wp-config-sample.php
├── wp-content
├── wp-cron.php
├── wp-includes
├── wp-links-opml.php
├── wp-load.php
├── wp-login.php
├── wp-mail.php
├── wp-settings.php
├── wp-signup.php
├── wp-trackback.php
└── xmlrpc.php
```

The root directory of WordPress contains files that are needed to configure WordPress to function correctly.

    index.php is the homepage of WordPress.

    license.txt contains useful information such as the version WordPress installed.

    wp-activate.php is used for the email activation process when setting up a new WordPress site.

    wp-admin folder contains the login page for administrator access and the backend dashboard. Once a user has logged in, they can make changes to the site based on their assigned permissions. The login page can be located at one of the following paths:
        /wp-admin/login.php
        /wp-admin/wp-login.php
        /login.php
        /wp-login.php


This file can also be renamed to make it more challenging to find the login page.



    xmlrpc.php is a file representing a feature of WordPress that enables data to be transmitted with HTTP acting as the transport mechanism and XML as the encoding mechanism. This type of communication has been replaced by the WordPress REST API.


The wp-config.php file contains information required by WordPress to connect to the database, such as the database name, database host, username and password, authentication keys and salts, and the database table prefix. This configuration file can also be used to activate DEBUG mode, which can useful in troubleshooting.

``` php
<?php
/** <SNIP> */
/** The name of the database for WordPress */
define( 'DB_NAME', 'database_name_here' );

/** MySQL database username */
define( 'DB_USER', 'username_here' );

/** MySQL database password */
define( 'DB_PASSWORD', 'password_here' );

/** MySQL hostname */
define( 'DB_HOST', 'localhost' );

/** Authentication Unique Keys and Salts */
/* <SNIP> */
define( 'AUTH_KEY',         'put your unique phrase here' );
define( 'SECURE_AUTH_KEY',  'put your unique phrase here' );
define( 'LOGGED_IN_KEY',    'put your unique phrase here' );
define( 'NONCE_KEY',        'put your unique phrase here' );
define( 'AUTH_SALT',        'put your unique phrase here' );
define( 'SECURE_AUTH_SALT', 'put your unique phrase here' );
define( 'LOGGED_IN_SALT',   'put your unique phrase here' );
define( 'NONCE_SALT',       'put your unique phrase here' );

/** WordPress Database Table prefix */
$table_prefix = 'wp_';

/** For developers: WordPress debugging mode. */
/** <SNIP> */
define( 'WP_DEBUG', false );

/** Absolute path to the WordPress directory. */
if ( ! defined( 'ABSPATH' ) ) {
	define( 'ABSPATH', __DIR__ . '/' );
}

/** Sets up WordPress vars and included files. */
require_once ABSPATH . 'wp-settings.php';
```

The wp-content folder is the main directory where plugins and themes are stored. The subdirectory uploads/ is usually where any files uploaded to the platform are stored. These directories and files should be carefully enumerated as they may lead to contain sensitive data that could lead to remote code execution or exploitation of other vulnerabilities or misconfigurations.

```
tree -L 1 /var/www/html/wp-content
.
├── index.php
├── plugins
└── themes
```

wp-includes contains everything except for the administrative components and the themes that belong to the website. This is the directory where core files are stored, such as certificates, fonts, JavaScript files, and widgets.

```
tree -L 1 /var/www/html/wp-includes
.
├── <SNIP>
├── theme.php
├── update.php
├── user.php
├── vars.php
├── version.php
├── widgets
├── widgets.php
├── wlwmanifest.xml
├── wp-db.php
└── wp-diff.php
```

## Wordpress User Roles

There are five types of users in a standard WordPress installation.
Role 	Description
Administrator 	This user has access to administrative features within the website. This includes adding and deleting users and posts, as well as editing source code.
Editor 	An editor can publish and manage posts, including the posts of other users.
Author 	Authors can publish and manage their own posts.
Contributor 	These users can write and manage their own posts but cannot publish them.
Subscriber 	These are normal users who can browse posts and edit their profiles.

Gaining access as an administrator is usually needed to obtain code execution on the server. However, editors and authors might have access to certain vulnerable plugins that normal users do not.
