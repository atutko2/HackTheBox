# Intro

## Intro to Command Injections

Command injection is when user input is taken and not sanatized, then used as part of a command on the server. This allows for a potentially breaking out of the confines of that command and running un-expected and potentially harmful commands on the server.

There are lots of examples of command injection, SQL Injection, Code Injection, OS Command Injection, etc. This is currently number 3 on OWASP top 10 Web App Risks.
