# Intro 

## Intro to File Inclusions

Many modern back-end languages, such as PHP, Javascript, or Java, use HTTP parameters to specify what is shown on the web page, which allows for building dynamic web pages, reduces the script's overall size, and simplifies the code. In such cases, parameters are used to specify which resource is shown on the page. If such functionalities are not securely coded, an attacker may manipulate these parameters to display the content of any local file on the hosting server, leading to a Local File Inclusion (LFI) vulnerability.

The most common place we usually find LFI within is templating engines. In order to have most of the web application looking the same when navigating between pages, a templating engine displays a page that shows the common static parts, such as the header, navigation bar, and footer, and then dynamically loads other content that changes between pages. Otherwise, every page on the server would need to be modified when changes are made to any of the static parts. This is why we often see a parameter like /index.php?page=about, where index.php sets static content (e.g. header/footer), and then only pulls the dynamic content specified in the parameter, which in this case may be read from a file called about.php. As we have control over the about portion of the request, it may be possible to have the web application grab other files and display them on the page.

LFI vulnerabilities can lead to source code disclosure, sensitive data exposure, and even remote code execution under certain conditions. Leaking source code may allow attackers to test the code for other vulnerabilities, which may reveal previously unknown vulnerabilities. Furthermore, leaking sensitive data may enable attackers to enumerate the remote server for other weaknesses or even leak credentials and keys that may allow them to access the remote server directly. Under specific conditions, LFI may also allow attackers to execute code on the remote server, which may compromise the entire back-end server and any other servers connected to it.

Let's look at some examples of code vulnerable to File Inclusion to understand how such vulnerabilities occur. As mentioned earlier, file Inclusion vulnerabilities can occur in many of the most popular web servers and development frameworks, like PHP, NodeJS, Java, .Net, and many others. Each of them has a slightly different approach to including local files, but they all share one common thing: loading a file from a specified path.

Such a file could be a dynamic header or different content based on the user-specified language. For example, the page may have a ?language GET parameter, and if a user changes the language from a drop-down menu, then the same page would be returned but with a different language parameter (e.g. ?language=es). In such cases, changing the language may change the directory the web application is loading the pages from (e.g. /en/ or /es/). If we have control over the path being loaded, then we may be able to exploit this vulnerability to read other files and potentially reach remote code execution.

In PHP, we may use the include() function to load a local or a remote file as we load a page. If the path passed to the include() is taken from a user-controlled parameter, like a GET parameter, and the code does not explicitly filter and sanitize the user input, then the code becomes vulnerable to File Inclusion. The following code snippet shows an example of that:

``` php
if (isset($_GET['language'])) {
    include($_GET['language']);
}
```

We see that the language parameter is directly passed to the include() function. So, any path we pass in the language parameter will be loaded on the page, including any local files on the back-end server. This is not exclusive to the include() function, as there are many other PHP functions that would lead to the same vulnerability if we had control over the path passed into them. Such functions include include_once(), require(), require_once(), file_get_contents(), and several others as well.

Note: In this module, we will mostly focus on PHP web applications running on a Linux back-end server. However, most techniques and attacks would work on the majority of other frameworks, so our examples would be the same with a web application written in any other language.

Just as the case with PHP, NodeJS web servers may also load content based on an HTTP parameters. The following is a basic example of how a GET parameter language is used to control what data is written to a page:

``` javascript
if(req.query.language) {
    fs.readFile(path.join(__dirname, req.query.language), function (err, data) {
        res.write(data);
    });
}
```

As we can see, whatever parameter passed from the URL gets used by the readfile function, which then writes the file content in the HTTP response. Another example is the render() function in the Express.js framework. The following example shows uses the language parameter to determine which directory it should pull the about.html page from:

``` js
app.get("/about/:language", function(req, res) {
    res.render(`/${req.params.language}/about.html`);
});
```

Unlike our earlier examples where GET parameters were specified after a (?) character in the URL, the above example takes the parameter from the URL path (e.g. /about/en or /about/es). As the parameter is directly used within the render() function to specify the rendered file, we can change the URL to show a different file instead.

### Java
The same concept applies to many other web servers. The following examples show how web applications for a Java web server may include local files based on the specified parameter, using the include function:

``` jsp
<c:if test="${not empty param.language}">
    <jsp:include file="<%= request.getParameter('language') %>" />
</c:if>
```

The include function may take a file or a page URL as its argument and then renders the object into the front-end template, similar to the ones we saw earlier with NodeJS. The import function may also be used to render a local file or a URL, such as the following example:

``` jsp
<c:import url= "<%= request.getParameter('language') %>"/>
```

Finally, let's take an example of how File Inclusion vulnerabilities may occur in .NET web applications. The Response.WriteFile function works very similarly to all of our earlier examples, as it takes a file path for its input and writes its content to the response. The path may be retrieved from a GET parameter for dynamic content loading, as follows:

``` cs
@if (!string.IsNullOrEmpty(HttpContext.Request.Query['language'])) {
    <% Response.WriteFile("<% HttpContext.Request.Query['language'] %>"); %> 
}
```

Furthermore, the @Html.Partial() function may also be used to render the specified file as part of the front-end template, similarly to what we saw earlier:

``` cs
@Html.Partial(HttpContext.Request.Query['language'])
```

Finally, the include function may be used to render local files or remote URLs, and may also execute the specified files as well:

``` cs
<!--#include file="<% HttpContext.Request.Query['language'] %>"-->

```

From all of the above examples, we can see that File Inclusion vulnerabilities may occur in any web server and any development frameworks, as all of them provide functionalities for loading dynamic content and handling front-end templates.

The most important thing to keep in mind is that some of the above functions only read the content of the specified files, while others also execute the specified files. Furthermore, some of them allow specifying remote URLs, while others only work with files local to the back-end server.

The following table shows which functions may execute files and which only read file content:

```
Function 			Read Content    Execute Remote URL
PHP 			
include()/include_once() 	✅ 		✅ 	✅
require()/require_once() 	✅ 		✅ 	❌
file_get_contents() 		✅ 		❌ 	✅
fopen()/file() 			✅ 		❌ 	❌
NodeJS 			
fs.readFile() 			✅ 		❌ 	❌
fs.sendFile() 			✅ 		❌ 	❌
res.render() 			✅ 		✅ 	❌
Java 			
include 			✅ 		❌ 	❌
import 				✅ 		✅ 	✅
.NET 			
@Html.Partial() 		✅ 		❌ 	❌
@Html.RemotePartial() 		✅ 		❌ 	✅
Response.WriteFile() 		✅ 		❌ 	❌
include 			✅ 		✅ 	✅
```

This is a significant difference to note, as executing files may allow us to execute functions and eventually lead to code execution, while only reading the file's content would only let us to read the source code without code execution. Furthermore, if we had access to the source code in a whitebox exercise or in a code audit, knowing these actions helps us in identifying potential File Inclusion vulnerabilities, especially if they had user-controlled input going into them.

In all cases, File Inclusion vulnerabilities are critical and may eventually lead to compromising the entire back-end server. Even if we were only able to read the web application source code, it may still allow us to compromise the web application, as it may reveal other vulnerabilities as mentioned earlier, and the source code may also contain database keys, admin credentials, or other sensitive information.

# File Disclosure

## Local File Inclusion (LFI)

The exercise we have at the end of this section shows us an example of a web app that allows users to set their language to either English or Spanish: 

If we select a language by clicking on it (e.g. Spanish), we see that the content text changes to spanish: 

We also notice that the URL includes a language parameter that is now set to the language we selected (es.php). There are several ways the content could be changed to match the language we specified. It may be pulling the content from a different database table based on the specified parameter, or it may be loading an entirely different version of the web app. However, as previously discussed, loading part of the page using template engines is the easiest and most common method utilized.

So, if the web application is indeed pulling a file that is now being included in the page, we may be able to change the file being pulled to read the content of a different local file. Two common readable files that are available on most back-end servers are /etc/passwd on Linux and C:\Windows\boot.ini on Windows. So, let's change the parameter from es to /etc/passwd: 

As we can see, the page is indeed vulnerable, and we are able to read the content of the passwd file and identify what users exist on the back-end server.

In the earlier example, we read a file by specifying its absolute path (e.g. /etc/passwd). This would work if the whole input was used within the include() function without any additions, like the following example:

``` php
include($_GET['language']);
```

In this case, if we try to read /etc/passwd, then the include() function would fetch that file directly. However, in many occasions, web developers may append or prepend a string to the language parameter. For example, the language parameter may be used for the filename, and may be added after a directory, as follow

``` php
include("./languages/" . $_GET['language']);
```

In this case, if we attempt to read /etc/passwd, then the path passed to include() would be (./languages//etc/passwd), and as this file does not exist, we will not be able to read anything: 

As expected, the verbose error returned shows us the string passed to the include() function, stating that there is no /etc/passwd in the languages directory.

Note: We are only enabling PHP errors on this web application for educational purposes, so we can properly understand how the web application is handling our input. For production web applications, such errors should never be shown. Furthermore, all of our attacks should be possible without errors, as they do not rely on them.

We can easily bypass this restriction by traversing directories using relative paths. To do so, we can add ../ before our file name, which refers to the parent directory. For example, if the full path of the languages directory is /var/www/html/languages/, then using ../index.php would refer to the index.php file on the parent directory (i.e. /var/www/html/index.php).

So, we can use this trick to go back several directories until we reach the root path (i.e. /), and then specify our absolute file path (e.g. ../../../../etc/passwd), and the file should exist: 

As we can see, this time we were able to read the file regardless of the directory we were in. This trick would work even if the entire parameter was used in the include() function, so we can default to this technique, and it should work in both cases. Furthermore, if we were at the root path (/) and used ../ then we would still remain in the root path. So, if we were not sure of the directory the web application is in, we can add ../ many times, and it should not break the path (even if we do it a hundred times!).

In our previous example, we used the language parameter after the directory, so we could traverse the path to read the passwd file. On some occasions, our input may be appended after a different string. For example, it may be used with a prefix to get the full filename, like the following example:

``` php
include("lang_" . $_GET['language']);
```

In this case, if we try to traverse the directory with ../../../etc/passwd, the final string would be lang_../../../etc/passwd, which is invalid: 

As expected, the error tells us that this file does not exist. so, instead of directly using path traversal, we can prefix a / before our payload, and this should consider the prefix as a directory, and then we should bypass the filename and be able to traverse directories: 

Note: This may not always work, as in this example a directory named lang_/ may not exist, so our relative path may not be correct. Furthermore, any prefix appended to our input may break some file inclusion techniques we will discuss in upcoming sections, like using PHP wrappers and filters or RFI.

Another very common example is when an extension is appended to the language parameter, as follows:

``` php
include($_GET['language'] . ".php");
```

This is quite common, as in this case, we would not have to write the extension every time we need to change the language. This may also be safer as it may restrict us to only including PHP files. In this case, if we try to read /etc/passwd, then the file included would be /etc/passwd.php, which does not exist: 


There are several techniques that we can use to bypass this, and we will discuss them in upcoming sections.

As we can see, LFI attacks can come in different shapes. Another common, and a little bit more advanced, LFI attack is a Second Order Attack. This occurs because many web application functionalities may be insecurely pulling files from the back-end server based on user-controlled parameters.

For example, a web application may allow us to download our avatar through a URL like (/profile/$username/avatar.png). If we craft a malicious LFI username (e.g. ../../../etc/passwd), then it may be possible to change the file being pulled to another local file on the server and grab it instead of our avatar.

In this case, we would be poisoning a database entry with a malicious LFI payload in our username. Then, another web application functionality would utilize this poisoned entry to perform our attack (i.e. download our avatar based on username value). This is why this attack is called a Second-Order attack.

Developers often overlook these vulnerabilities, as they may protect against direct user input (e.g. from a ?page parameter), but they may trust values pulled from their database, like our username in this case. If we managed to poison our username during our registration, then the attack would be possible.

Exploiting LFI vulnerabilities using second-order attacks is similar to what we have discussed in this section. The only variance is that we need to spot a function that pulls a file based on a value we indirectly control and then try to control that value to exploit the vulnerability.

--------------
The questions in this section are:

Using the file inclusion find the name of a user on the system that starts with "b". 

Just opening this http://94.237.54.176:35002/index.php?language=../../../../etc/passwd shows all the users.

barry is the answer

Submit the contents of the flag.txt file located in the /usr/share/flags directory. 

Going to http://94.237.54.176:35002/index.php?language=../../../../usr/share/flags/flag.txt gets the answer

## Basic Bypasses

In the previous section, we saw several types of attacks that we can use for different types of LFI vulnerabilities. In many cases, we may be facing a web application that applies various protections against file inclusion, so our normal LFI payloads would not work. Still, unless the web application is properly secured against malicious LFI user input, we may be able to bypass the protections in place and reach file inclusion.

One of the most basic filters against LFI is a search and replace filter, where it simply deletes substrings of (../) to avoid path traversals. For example:

``` php
$language = str_replace('../', '', $_GET['language']);
```

The above code is supposed to prevent path traversal, and hence renders LFI useless. If we try the LFI payloads we tried in the previous section, we get the following: 

We see that all ../ substrings were removed, which resulted in a final path being ./languages/etc/passwd. However, this filter is very insecure, as it is not recursively removing the ../ substring, as it runs a single time on the input string and does not apply the filter on the output string. For example, if we use ....// as our payload, then the filter would remove ../ and the output string would be ../, which means we may still perform path traversal. Let's try applying this logic to include /etc/passwd again: 

As we can see, the inclusion was successful this time, and we're able to read /etc/passwd successfully. The ....// substring is not the only bypass we can use, as we may use ..././ or ....\/ and several other recursive LFI payloads. Furthermore, in some cases, escaping the forward slash character may also work to avoid path traversal filters (e.g. ....\/), or adding extra forward slashes (e.g. ....////)

Some web filters may prevent input filters that include certain LFI-related characters, like a dot . or a slash / used for path traversals. However, some of these filters may be bypassed by URL encoding our input, such that it would no longer include these bad characters, but would still be decoded back to our path traversal string once it reaches the vulnerable function. Core PHP filters on versions 5.3.4 and earlier were specifically vulnerable to this bypass, but even on newer versions we may find custom filters that may be bypassed through URL encoding.

If the target web application did not allow . and / in our input, we can URL encode ../ into %2e%2e%2f, which may bypass the filter. To do so, we can use any online URL encoder utility or use the Burp Suite Decoder tool, as follows: 

Note: For this to work we must URL encode all characters, including the dots. Some URL encoders may not encode dots as they are considered to be part of the URL scheme.

As we can see, we were also able to successfully bypass the filter and use path traversal to read /etc/passwd. Furthermore, we may also use Burp Decoder to encode the encoded string once again to have a double encoded string, which may also bypass other types of filters.

You may refer to the Command Injections module for more about bypassing various blacklisted characters, as the same techniques may be used with LFI as well.

Some web applications may also use Regular Expressions to ensure that the file being included is under a specific path. For example, the web application we have been dealing with may only accept paths that are under the ./languages directory, as follows:

``` php
if(preg_match('/^\.\/languages\/.+$/', $_GET['language'])) {
    include($_GET['language']);
} else {
    echo 'Illegal path specified!';
}
```

To find the approved path, we can examine the requests sent by the existing forms, and see what path they use for the normal web functionality. Furthermore, we can fuzz web directories under the same path, and try different ones until we get a match. To bypass this, we may use path traversal and start our payload with the approved path, and then use ../ to go back to the root directory and read the file we specify, as follows: 
`./languages/../../../../etc/passwd`

Some web applications may apply this filter along with one of the earlier filters, so we may combine both techniques by starting our payload with the approved path, and then URL encode our payload or use recursive payload.

As discussed in the previous section, some web applications append an extension to our input string (e.g. .php), to ensure that the file we include is in the expected extension. With modern versions of PHP, we may not be able to bypass this and will be restricted to only reading files in that extension, which may still be useful, as we will see in the next section (e.g. for reading source code).

There are a couple of other techniques we may use, but they are obsolete with modern versions of PHP and only work with PHP versions before 5.3/5.4. However, it may still be beneficial to mention them, as some web applications may still be running on older servers, and these techniques may be the only bypasses possible.

In earlier versions of PHP, defined strings have a maximum length of 4096 characters, likely due to the limitation of 32-bit systems. If a longer string is passed, it will simply be truncated, and any characters after the maximum length will be ignored. Furthermore, PHP also used to remove trailing slashes and single dots in path names, so if we call (/etc/passwd/.) then the /. would also be truncated, and PHP would call (/etc/passwd). PHP, and Linux systems in general, also disregard multiple slashes in the path (e.g. ////etc/passwd is the same as /etc/passwd). Similarly, a current directory shortcut (.) in the middle of the path would also be disregarded (e.g. /etc/./passwd).

If we combine both of these PHP limitations together, we can create very long strings that evaluate to a correct path. Whenever we reach the 4096 character limitation, the appended extension (.php) would be truncated, and we would have a path without an appended extension. Finally, it is also important to note that we would also need to start the path with a non-existing directory for this technique to work.

An example of such payload would be the following:

``` url
?language=non_existing_directory/../../../etc/passwd/./././.[./ REPEATED ~2048 times]
```

Of course, we don't have to manually type ./ 2048 times (total of 4096 characters), but we can automate the creation of this string with the following command:

`echo -n "non_existing_directory/../../../etc/passwd/" && for i in {1..2048}; do echo -n "./"; done`

We may also increase the count of ../, as adding more would still land us in the root directory, as explained in the previous section. However, if we use this method, we should calculate the full length of the string to ensure only .php gets truncated and not our requested file at the end of the string (/etc/passwd). This is why it would be easier to use the first method.

PHP versions before 5.5 were vulnerable to null byte injection, which means that adding a null byte (%00) at the end of the string would terminate the string and not consider anything after it. This is due to how strings are stored in low-level memory, where strings in memory must use a null byte to indicate the end of the string, as seen in Assembly, C, or C++ languages.

To exploit this vulnerability, we can end our payload with a null byte (e.g. /etc/passwd%00), such that the final path passed to include() would be (/etc/passwd%00.php). This way, even though .php is appended to our string, anything after the null byte would be truncated, and so the path used would actually be /etc/passwd, leading us to bypass the appended extension.

---------------

The question in this section is:
The above web application employs more than one filter to avoid LFI exploitation. Try to bypass these filters to read /flag.txt

Trying http://94.237.54.176:38605/index.php?language=../../../../etc/passwd I get:
Illegal path specified!

Which is what this code says:
``` php
if(preg_match('/^\.\/languages\/.+$/', $_GET['language'])) {
    include($_GET['language']);
} else {
    echo 'Illegal path specified!';
}
```

So my guess is it requires us to do use a valid subdir first.

trying http://94.237.54.176:38605/index.php?language=languages/../../../../../etc/passwd fails but doesn't give any output so lets try the doubled path traversal.

http://94.237.54.176:38605/index.php?language=languages/....//....//....//....//....//etc/passwd

And that works so I just need to do:
`http://94.237.54.176:38605/index.php?language=languages/....//....//....//....//....//flag.txt`
